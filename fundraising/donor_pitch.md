# *Life International Pharmaceutical Company (LIPC) – Donor Pitch*

## *Transforming Healthcare in Africa Through Science, Innovation & Manufacturing*

The Life International Pharmaceutical Company (LIPC) is an upcoming state-of-the-art scientific, medical, and pharmaceutical facility in Uganda.  
It will serve East, Central, and Sub-Saharan Africa by producing life-saving medicines, medical-grade water (D5, D10, NS), and advanced scientific research outputs.

Africa still imports over 90% of its medicines. LIPC exists to change this.

Our mission is to build Africa’s most advanced medical research and pharmaceutical production hub — reducing costs, increasing access, strengthening health security, and training the next generation of scientists.

# *Why LIPC is Urgent and Necessary*

- Africa’s population will reach 2.5 billion by 2050 — with severe medicine shortages.  
- Local production is the only sustainable way to secure affordable, reliable medical supplies.  
- Uganda is strategically positioned to supply the entire region.  
- LIPC will generate thousands of jobs and transform healthcare outcomes.
